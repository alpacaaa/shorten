# Shorten Field

A Symphony CMS field that shorten entry ids to tiny alphanumeric strings (like **u8X**).
You could build, for example, your own in-site url shortener service having urls like `$root/u8X`. How cool is that?

This is based on the [Entry URL Field](http://github.com/nickdunn/entry_url_field/) by Nick Dunn.


## Use

This field just stores an unique alpha-numeric short identifier for each of your entry.
It used to perform redirect too, but I felt that would have required an extension of its own because there are 
quite a few use cases that have to be adressed.
